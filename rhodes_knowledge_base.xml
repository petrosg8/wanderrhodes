    <section name="Rhodes: Uncovering the Island’s Hidden History">Rhodes isn’t just the island of sun and beaches-it’s a place where fascinating secrets of history are waiting to be discovered. Beyond its famous landmarks, the island hides stories and sites that add a whole new dimension to your . From Mythology to a Dazzling CityLegend has it that Rhodes emerged from the sea as a gift to the sun god Helios, perhaps explaining the island’s 300 days of sunshine each year. The ancient Rhodians honored Helios with the Colossus of Rhodes-one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Although the statue no longer stands, its spirit is still alive across the island. A City Designed by a VisionaryIn 408 BC, the three ancient cities of Rhodes united to found a new city, designed by the renowned Athenian architect Hippodamus. His revolutionary “Hippodamian” grid plan-straight, intersecting streets-can still be traced today, especially if you the Acropolis of Rhodes and Monte Smith Hill. The Medieval Old Town: A Living MuseumThe Old Town of Rhodes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a living, breathing monument. Here, you’ll stroll down the Street of the Knights, marvel at the Palace of the Grand Master, and discover hidden corners where everyday life continues much as it did centuries ago. The Italian Influence That Shaped RhodesDuring the Italian occupation (1912–1943), Rhodes was transformed with impressive new buildings: the Palace of the Grand Master was restored, the famous Kallithea Springs and the Casino of Rhodes (Grande Albergo delle Rose) were built, and the Church of the Annunciation was erected. This Italian architectural flair still gives the city a unique character-just take a walk along Mandraki Harbor and the seafront to see it for yourself. Secrets and Discoveries for the Curious or At the Acropolis of Rhodes and Monte Smith Hill, you can see the remains of the ancient city’s grid plan and the ruins of the Temple of Apollo.

Tips for a Great Experience in Rhodes: Use Cash: Locals prefer cash and often offer discounts for cash payments. This can lead to savings on your purchases. Use Local ATMs: Withdraw cash (Euros) from Greek bank ATMs (e.g., Piraeus, Alpha Bank, Eurobank, Ethniki) to avoid high fees from multinational machines. Always check the fees and exchange rates before withdrawing. Ask for Prices: Request a menu or price list wherever you go before you order or buy something.

It will save you both money and time, allowing you to discover hidden gems. Drive Safely: Always keep a safe distance from other vehicles, especially taxis, buses, and quads. Road safety is crucial for a pleasant driving experience.

Use the ‘MyCoast’ app to find spots where you can enjoy the beach without paying for a sunbed. Windy West Side: The west side of the island is almost always windy, making it ideal for windsurfing.

Avoid Tap Water: Drink bottled water unless you have a proper filtration system or have been assured that the tap water in your accommodation is safe to drink. Experience Local Festivals “Panigiri”: Enjoy local festivals known as “panigiria” in the villages, especially in July and August. These events offer great food, drinks, and authentic souvlaki. Dine in Villages: village tavernas for homemade local dishes and an authentic Greek experience. This is a great way to taste traditional cuisine and support local businesses.

    <section name="Western Side of the Aquarium - RhodesVerified listing"> Located on the western side of the Aquarium which is located at the northern part of Rhodes, this beach offers some of the most stunning views. The water is clean and refreshingly cold, and despite its proximity to the city center, it remains a tranquil spot. The reason for its relative quietness is the frequent strong winds, sea waves, and the steep drop-off as you enter the water. It's an excellent place to enjoy the waves, with quieter surroundings and more affordable sunbeds compared to Elli Beach. Most of the time, this side of the island experiences waves, but if you early in the morning or later in the evening, you’ll usually find it calmer. If you’re not in the mood for swimming in this side of the island, don’t miss an afternoon stroll to watch the breathtaking sunset. It’s a serene way to end the day! 🔑Tip: A handy tip for choosing where to swim is to look at the Greek flag flying above the Aquarium. The direction in which the flag is blowing indicates the side with calmer waters. 📍Western Side of the Aquarium F65C+58, Ρόδος 851 00, Ελλάδα F65C+58, Ρόδος 851 00, Ελλάδα </section>
